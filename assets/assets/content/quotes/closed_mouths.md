This simple yet powerful phrase encapsulates a fundamental truth about success and opportunity. It reminds us \-that-being\- passive rarely leads to **achieving** our goals. Whether in professional settings, personal relationships, or pursuit __of our dreams__, we must be willing to speak up and ***make our needs known***.

The quote encourages us to:
- Ask questions when we don't understand
- Voice our aspirations and goals
- Seek help when we need it
- Advocate for ourselves
